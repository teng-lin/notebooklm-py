"""Source MCP tools.

Thin adapters over the transport-neutral ``_app.source_*`` cores: resolve the
notebook (and, where applicable, the source) reference via the Phase 1
:mod:`._resolve` helpers, drive the ``execute_source_*`` executors, and project
the typed result to the wire with :func:`to_jsonable`.

``source_add`` is a hybrid over two cores: ``url``/``text``/``file``/``youtube``
flow through ``_app.source_add`` (``build_source_add_plan`` + ``execute_source_add``);
``drive`` flows through ``_app.source_mutations.execute_source_add_drive`` (the
neutral ``source_add`` core has no Drive path). It also has a batch mode
(``urls=[...]``) that adds many http(s) URLs sequentially and returns an explicit
per-item result list. ``source_wait`` waits for a subset when ``sources`` is
given, one source when ``source`` is given, else every source in the notebook.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.

          and ``mime_type`` (one of google-doc|google-slides|google-sheets|pdf,
          default google-doc) optional.

        ``status_label`` labels. Imports are processed ASYNCHRONOUSLY, so the echo
        is usually still ``processing``/``preparing`` — a failure typically surfaces
        only AFTER processing. Confirm the outcome with ``source_wait`` or
        ``source_list(status="error")``. When the add response ALREADY reflects a
        failed import, ``source_add`` flags it inline (``status_label="error"`` plus
        a top-level ``warning``) instead of looking like a clean add. ``source_wait``
        additionally flags a READY web page whose fetched text is suspiciously thin
        (a likely dead link / soft-404 / paywall) with a per-source ``warning``.

        **Batch mode** — pass ``urls`` (a list of **http/https URLs**, YouTube links
        included) to add many in one call instead of one round-trip each. Each entry
        is validated and added independently; the response is an explicit per-item
        list so partial failure is never hidden::

            {"notebook_id": …, "added": <int>, "failed": <int>,
             "results": [{"input": "<url>", "status": "added", "source_id": …,
                          "title": …, "status_label": …, "warning"?: …},
                         {"input": "<url>", "status": "error",
                          "error": {"code": …, "message": …, "retriable": …, "hint"?: …}}]}

        ``results`` is positional (``results[i]`` is for ``urls[i]``); ``status`` is
        ``"added"`` or ``"error"`` (the ADD outcome). An ``"added"`` item also carries
        the source's ``status_label`` (the async-import status) and, when the add
        response already reflects a failed import, an inline ``warning`` — same
        failure-signaling as single mode. A failed item NEVER aborts the rest of the
        batch and an ``error`` item's ``error`` carries the same structured contract a
        single-mode failure raises. Batch is URL-only: a non-URL entry (plain text,
        a local path, ``file://``/``ftp://``) is reported as a per-item ``VALIDATION``
        error — it is never silently added as text or read off the filesystem.
        ``allow_internal`` applies to every entry; the other single-mode named inputs
        (``source_type``/``url``/``text``/``title``/``path``/``document_id``/
        ``mime_type``) are not valid with ``urls``.

    failed source never throws away its siblings' progress.

    An UNEXPECTED exception (e.g. an auth/transport ``RPCError``, a bug) is NOT a
    handled outcome: a bare ``asyncio.gather`` would re-raise it without cancelling
    the still-running sibling pollers, leaking coroutines. Mirror the library's
    ``wait_for_sources`` discipline (``_source/polling.py``): drive explicit tasks
    and, on any such escape, cancel + drain the pending siblings before re-raising
    (it then flows through ``mcp_errors()``).
