"""Stage B1 PR 2 — executor persists across ``close()`` → ``open()``.

Replacement regression test for the deleted
``test_runtime_lifecycle.test_close_nulls_rpc_executor``. Before Stage B1 PR 2
of the post-refactoring plan, lifecycle close logic nulled out the client-owned
executor so a follow-up :meth:`open` would rebuild it against the new
``httpx.AsyncClient``.

PR 2 deleted both that null line and the lazy factory itself — the
executor is bound exactly once by the composition root
(:func:`notebooklm._runtime.init.build_web_runtime`) via
the backend-owned runtime, and the same instance
survives any ``close()`` → ``open()`` cycle. This is safe because the executor's
transport collaborator (:class:`Kernel`) rebuilds its
``httpx.AsyncClient`` lazily on each :meth:`Kernel.open`, so a stale
executor reference continues to drive RPCs against a fresh transport.

This module pins three load-bearing invariants:

1. The :class:`RpcExecutor` instance is identity-equal before and after
   a full ``close()`` → ``open()`` cycle.
2. The reused executor can still execute an RPC after the cycle (it is
   not bound to a stale transport reference).
3. ``NotebookLMClient._backend._runtime`` remains the single execution owner.
